## Purpose
* Utilizing Pricefx to provide recommendations by determining the one optimal price for each customer mother account according to various price elasticities

## Assignment Requirement

**What do you see in the data?**
* Is there a variance that customers are paying by location or something else?  
* Are we leaving money on the table with low prices or losing opportunities to upsell because of high prices?

**What would you recommend as a pricing strategy as we start to put customers on one contract (and potentially a consolidated price list)?**  
* What was your methodology to answer the above questions?
* Explain research steps
* Share visualization created    
* Describe any business or data rules used

**What is the potential impact of your recommendations?**


## Decriptive Method to measure data
* Control factors: `Billcode Type`, `Market name` and `time`
* select customer child accounts with same locations to check the difference of prices
* select customer child accounts with same number of accounts to check the difference of prices
* We found that there were the price variances by locations or number of accounts

## Recommandations

### Methdology
* Collect Data from the [FICO](https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge?tabset-3158a=2)
* Utilize `Pandas` to clean data
* Remove Column with more than 90% omitted data
* Modify other omitted data by Imputer strategy `mean`
* Divide whole data frame into `Train_set` & `Test_set`
