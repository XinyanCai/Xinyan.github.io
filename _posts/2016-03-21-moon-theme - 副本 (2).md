## Purpose
* Utilizing Pricefx to provide recommendations by determining the one optimal price for each customer mother account according to various price elasticities

## Assignment Requirement

**What do you see in the data?**
* Is there a variance that customers are paying by location or something else?  
* Are we leaving money on the table with low prices or losing opportunities to upsell because of high prices?

**What would you recommend as a pricing strategy as we start to put customers on one contract (and potentially a consolidated price list)?**  
* What was your methodology to answer the above questions?
* Explain research steps
* Share visualization created    
* Describe any business or data rules used

**What is the potential impact of your recommendations?**


## Decriptive Method to measure data
* Control factors: `Billcode Type`, `Market name` and `time`
* select customer child accounts with same locations to check the difference of prices
* select customer child accounts with same number of accounts to check the difference of prices
* We found that there were the price variances by locations or number of accounts

## Recommandations

### Methdology
* Collect Data from the [FICO](https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge?tabset-3158a=2)
* Utilize `Pandas` to clean data
* Remove Column with more than 90% omitted data
* Modify other omitted data by Imputer strategy `mean`
* Divide whole data frame into `Train_set` & `Test_set`

### Final Recommendations
**1. Determing new prices of  LA-acquired after acquisition**
* For the customer mother account having most(or all) percentage of service and transport bill code types, setting price at around $10 
* For the customer mother account having most(or all) percentage of storage bill code type, setting price at around $0.8

**2. Determining a consolidated price in the rest of the market (except LA-acquired)**
* For customer mother account with high proportion of storage Bill code types, setting simple mean price if the demand is inelastic, otherwise we need to make a balance of weighted mean and simple mean to obtain higher revenue
* For customer mother account with low proportion of storage Bill code types, both simple mean price and weighted average mean price will work

**3. Remaining differenet prices in different locations**
* Better strategy: remain setting different prices in different locations 
* Follow the logic of price discrimination
