## Purpose
* Utilizing Pricefx to provide recommendations by determining the one optimal price for each customer mother account according to various price elasticities

## Assignment Requirement

**What do you see in the data?**
* Is there a variance that customers are paying by location or something else?  
* Are we leaving money on the table with low prices or losing opportunities to upsell because of high prices?

**What would you recommend as a pricing strategy as we start to put customers on one contract (and potentially a consolidated price list)?**  
* What was your methodology to answer the above questions?
* Explain research steps
* Share visualization created    
* Describe any business or data rules used

**What is the potential impact of your recommendations?**


## Decriptive Method to measure data
* Control factors: `Billcode Type`, `Market name` and `time`
* select customer child accounts with same locations to check the difference of prices
* select customer child accounts with same number of accounts to check the difference of prices
* We found that there were the price variances by locations or number of accounts

## Recommandations

### Methdology
* Collect Data from the pricefx (a private platform need username and password)
* Calculate weighted mean prices of LA within each mother account and utilize them as the new prices of LA-acquired as reason of same location
* Calculate the weighted mean and simple mean prices for each customer mother account in the rest of the market (other locations)
* Calculate the price elacticities of each mother account
* Compare the single price stategy with the previous scenario (setting different prices within one customer mother account through different locations)

### Final Recommendations
**1. Determing new prices of  LA-acquired after acquisition**
* For the customer mother account having most(or all) percentage of service and transport bill code types, setting price at around $10 
* For the customer mother account having most(or all) percentage of storage bill code type, setting price at around $0.8

**2. Determining a consolidated price in the rest of the market (except LA-acquired)**
* For customer mother account with high proportion of storage Bill code types, setting simple mean price if the demand is inelastic, otherwise we need to make a balance of weighted mean and simple mean to obtain higher revenue
* For customer mother account with low proportion of storage Bill code types, both simple mean price and weighted average mean price will work

**3. Remaining differenet prices in different locations**
* Better strategy: remain setting different prices in different locations 
* Follow the logic of price discrimination
